#### Manual Post-Processing: Guidelines
The file ```Guidelines.pdf``` presents guidelines and desired corrections for manual post-processing of the collected responses from participants to the target stimuli through a human annotator. The goal of the post-processing step is to allow for meaningful automatic processing and usage of the responses.

#### Associations
The collected associations are in the folder ```associations```. Within the folder, the responses are categorized into associates to PNCs and names as well as first-only associations (listing only the very first response obtained for a specific target) and association chains (listing all associations provided to a specific target). 

We also provide a file for PNC and names respectively which includes first-only and association chain responses along with additional collected data such as subjective perception scores, age indiciations.

<!---  We collected the data through Prolific which provides supplemental demographic data of participants including occupation, ethnicitiy, and gender. We provide this information in the file ```demographic-information```. Information can be matched to individual responses using participant IDs. --->
